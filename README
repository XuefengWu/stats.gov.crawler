=====================================

## Setup
1. Type "./sbt" in the directory. This will download the internet, and run sbt.
2. Type "run".  This will compile everything and launch the server on port 9000.

## SBT commands
From within the SBT prompt, there are stacks of commands. Here are some useful ones:
* h2-browser - browse the contents of database. First from your console start bare 'play' console, run h2-browser and finally run your app (withinh the same play console)
* run  - As mentioned above, this will start the server.  It should hot-load Scala code changes.

## Start
sudo /home/twer/utils/play-2.2.1/play "start -Dhttp.port=80 -Dconfig.resource=prod.conf"

## IDE
* I've used the Eclipse plugin and it's very good these days. "sbt eclipse" will create your Eclipse project; you can them import it with File > Import.  However, I recommend downloading the [Scala Eclipse IDE](http://scala-ide.org/) separately, rather than adding the Scala plugin to your existing Eclipse.  This should eliminate version incompatibilities and inter-plugin warfare.
* Intellij is supposed to be good too; you can generate Intellij files by typing "sbt idea".
* You can find Scala Vim colors [here](https://github.com/scala/scala-dist/tree/master/tool-support/src/vim),
* For Emacs there is the apparently excellent [ENSIME](https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime).
